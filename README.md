# practice_DL

Welcome to my Deep Learning practice repo!  
This repo contains my learning journey — from building neural networks from scratch to experimenting with transfer learning and optimization techniques.

---

## 🔍 What’s Inside?

### ✅ Basic Foundations
- `tensors.ipynb` – Playing with PyTorch tensors.
- `basic.ipynb` – Getting comfortable with basic PyTorch workflows.
- `learning_NN_classFunctionality.ipynb` – Understanding how `nn.Module` works.

---

### 🧠 ANN Projects
- `ann_fashionMnist.ipynb` – A simple feed-forward network on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- `ann_fashionMnist_GPU&Optimized.ipynb` – Model training optimized and pushed to GPU.
- `ann_fashionMnist_GPU&Optimized_optuna.ipynb` – Added hyperparameter tuning using Optuna for better performance (accuracy ~82%).

---

### 📦 Model Training Pipeline
- `training_pipeline.ipynb` – Manual training pipeline with no modularization.
- `training_pipeline_NNmodule.ipynb` – Refactored using classes for cleaner code and reusable components.

---

### 🧠 CNN Projects
- `cnn_fashion_mnist.ipynb` – Applied Convolutional Neural Network to Fashion MNIST.

---

### 🚀 Transfer Learning
- `Transferlearning_fashion_mnist_gpu.ipynb`  
  Used **VGG16** for transfer learning to classify Fashion MNIST on GPU.  
  Optuna helped pick the best hyperparameters.

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- Python, PyTorch
- GPU (Google Colab)
- Optuna for hyperparameter tuning
- OpenCV (coming soon)
